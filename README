NAME
     uncsv — (un‐)escape/(un‐)quote to and from a CSV stream

SYNOPSIS
     uncsv [−hV] [−d delimiter] [−n repl] [−r repl] [file ...]
     csv [−hV] [−d delimiter] [−n repl] [−r repl] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     uncsv is a filter command converting the lines of a CSV file into non‐
     escaped, non‐quoted delimited file (pipe by default). This program will
     error out if it encounters a character matching the delimiter, it will
     also replace all the carriage return and new‐line characters (spaces by
     default, see ‐r and ‐n); assuming you are planning on using ordinary UNIX
     tools with the output, this is what you want.

     csv is the opposite of this command. It takes an unquoted stream of val‐
     ues, separated by the delimiter of your choice (default: pipe ’|’) and
     produces a "standard" CSV file.

     Both tools avoid end‐of‐line character politics and will leave these
     untouched, if your file comes with both carriage returns and new‐line
     characters (\r\n a.k.a. CRLF), uncsv will leave them as‐is.

     The options are as follows:

     −d delimiter
	     Specify the output delimiter for uncsv and the input delimiter
	     for csv , defaults to the pipe character ’|’. If the delimiter is
	     found in the input data, both programs interrupt.

     −n repl
	     If specified, all the new‐line characters (a.k.a. line feed or
	     \n) will be replaced by this replacement string.  uncsv replaces
	     them by spaces by default which is destructive.  csv will do the
	     opposite and replace this pattern by an actual new line charac‐
	     ter.

     −r repl
	     If specified, all the carriage return characters (a.k.a. \r) will
	     be replaced by this replacement string.  uncsv replaces them by
	     spaces by default which is destructive.  csv will do the opposite
	     and replace this pattern by an actual carriage return character.

     −s      Quote all fields with a heading or trailing space (or tab). This
	     is only applicable when generating the CSV stream.

     −V      Print version.

     −h      Print usage.

EXAMPLES
      # Print the second field of a CSV:
      uncsv file.csv | awk ‐F\| ’{ print $2 }’

      # Convert a CSV to un‐quoted tab‐delimited format:
      uncsv ‐d’\t’ < file.csv > delimited

      # Convert a PostgreSQL output to CSV:
      $ psql yourdb
      psql> \f\a
      psql> \o | csv > /tmp/output.csv
      psql> select * from candies;
      psql> \o
