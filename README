NAME
     uncsv — un‐escape/un‐quote a CSV stream

SYNOPSIS
     uncsv [−hV] [−d delimiter] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     uncsv is a filter command converting the lines of a CSV file into non‐
     escaped, non‐quoted delimited file (pipe by default). This program will
     error out if it encounters a character matching the delimiter, it will
     also replace all the carriage return and new‐line characters by spaces;
     assuming you are planning on using ordinary UNIX tools with the output,
     this is what you want.

     The options are as follows:

     −d delimiter
	     Specify the output delimiter, defaults to the pipe character ’|’.
	     If the delimiter is found in the input data, the program inter‐
	     rupts.

     −V      Print version.

     −h      Print usage.

EXAMPLES
      # Print the second field of a CSV.
      uncsv file.csv | awk ‐F\| ’{ print $2 }’

      # Convert a CSV to un‐quoted tab‐delimited format.
      uncsv ‐d’\t’ < file.csv > delimited

SEE ALSO
     awk(1), cut(1)
